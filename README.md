This repository contains a machine learning project analyzing the performance of SVM and Logistic Regression models. It explores the impact of hyperparameters such as gamma and C on model accuracy and decision boundaries. The project demonstrates the trade-offs between simplicity, overfitting, and generalization, with detailed results showing the superiority of low-gamma SVM for nonlinear relationships. Ideal for those studying ML model tuning and decision boundary visualization.
